<Layout title="uses" description="hardware and software i use">
	<h1>uses</h1>
	<p>
		i often get asked about the stuff that i use so i wanted to make a
		comprehensive page listing mostly everything. i will probably update this
		list over time as it also helps me keep track of what i'm using - and maybe
		it'd be useful to help some people discover new software and hardware
		aswell.
	</p>
	<h2>hardware</h2>
	<p>
		my main computer is an <em>M4 MacBook Air</em> configured with 24gb of memory
		and 1tb of storage. i use <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a> and <a
			href="https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin">nix-darwin</a
		>, along with <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> for GUI applications. i mostly
		went for a MacBook because I wanted to use Logic Pro, and audio production SUCKS
		on linux. but also because i haven't been really enjoying Windows lately. i also
		love the hardware. the trackpad, display, and battery life are great, and the
		speakers are the best i've ever heard from a laptop.
	</p>
	<p>
		i also have a <em>Surface</em> laptop, running Windows, which i use for games.
		but i don't really do much else on there. i would like to install Linux on there,
		but it doesn't really play nicely with my dock (Dell WD19TB). also for whatever
		reason on Linux it always runs the Nvidia GPU at the lowest power setting, making
		games unplayable. (the Nvidia driver seems to think that it's always on battery
		power.)
	</p>
	<p>
		i also play and emulate games on my <em
			><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck</a></em
		> very often. it's a 256GB LCD model. this has been a very good purchase and i'd
		heavily recommend it if you're into pc gaming and you want something portable
		:)
	</p>
	<p>
		i have my old desktop which i use as my main server since i don't really
		have any other use for it. it's running <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a
		>. i run <a href="https://jellyfin.org">Jellyfin</a> for movies/tv, <a
			href="https://www.navidrome.org">Navidrome</a
		> for streaming my music library, <a href="https://restic.net">restic</a> and
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)">Time Machine</a
		> backup shares, and Minecraft servers for my friends. i also run <a
			href="https://www.samba.org">Samba</a
		> shares.
	</p>
	<p>
		i also have an <em>Intel NUC</em> (i forgot exactly which generation) which was
		the previous computer i used as my server before i upgraded to my old desktop.
		this is currently unused.
	</p>
	<p>
		i have a <em>Raspberry Pi 4</em> which i used to run RetroPie on. currently it's
		unused though, and i'm thinking of ways i could use it.
	</p>
	<p>
		i have an <em>iPhone 14 Pro</em>, mainly because i wanted GarageBand at the
		time but it also plays nicely with my Mac. i'm considering switching to a
		Pixel at some point though.
	</p>
	<p>
		i also enjoy messing with retro/vintage hardware and have some older
		computers:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			i very often use my <em>5th gen iPod</em> to listen to my music library on the
			go and at home, since it's distraction-free and fun to tinker with. i run
			<a href="https://www.rockbox.org">Rockbox</a> on here with <a
				href="https://github.com/D0-0K/adwaitapod">adwaitapod</a
			>, the best Rockbox theme ;)
		</li>
		<li>
			sometimes i used to use my <em>4th gen iPod Touch</em> for distraction-free
			music listening and those classic mobile games. i do quite miss when mobile
			devices were small and easier to handle, and this is nice to bring to places
			where i don't want my phone
		</li>
		<li>
			i have a <em>Gateway</em> laptop from 2003 that i don't really use, but sometimes
			mess around with it for shits and giggles
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>also here's the gear i use for music:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			audio workstation: i mostly use <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro"
				>Logic Pro</a
			> or <a href="https://www.bitwig.com">Bitwig</a> or <a
				href="https://www.image-line.com">FL Studio</a
			>
		</li>
		<li>
			instruments: i have a Donner Hush X, a Squier stratocaster, some acoustic
			Yamaha, a ukulele, and a Yamaha keyboard.
		</li>
		<li>
			virtual plugins: Logic's stock, ValhallaDSP, MeldaProduction, Spitfire
			Audio LABS
		</li>
		<li>
			midi controller: i use that Yamaha keyboard along with my <a
				href="https://www.arturia.com/products/hybrid-synths/minilab-3/overview"
				>Arturia Minilab 3</a
			>.
		</li>
		<li>
			microphone: i typically use an <a
				href="https://www.akg.com/microphones/condenser-microphones/P120-.html"
				>AKG P120</a
			>.
		</li>
		<li>
			audio interface: i use a <a
				href="https://us.focusrite.com/products/scarlett-solo-3rd-gen"
				>Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Gen</a
			>. however, sometimes on the go, i just plug in my <a
				href="https://www.fender.com/products/mustang-micro"
				>Fender Mustang Micro</a
			> and start recording, but the latency is sometimes kinda bad when plugged into
			the laptop
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>software</h2>
	<h3>operating systems</h3>
	<p>
		on desktop i mostly prefer MacOS, NixOS, Fedora, and Debian. for servers i
		run NixOS because it's just so convenient. i also run Windows for gaming. i
		previously used Arch rather than NixOS but it was far too unstable for my
		liking and i prefer the declarative approach that NixOS offers.
	</p>
	<p>
		if game anti-cheat worked on Linux i would probably switch to it full-time.
		maybe. though i still need Logic Pro and Final Cut, which are
		macOS-exclusive.
	</p>
	<h3>desktop</h3>
	<p>
		on linux i typically use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME"
			>GNOME</a
		>, but i've also been switching between <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE">KDE</a
		> and GNOME ever since KDE 6 released. i also use <a
			href="https://swaywm.org">Sway</a
		>. when using KDE i often enjoy <a
			href="https://gitgud.io/wackyideas/aerothemeplasma">AeroThemePlasma</a
		> ;)
	</p>
	<p>
		on the desktop i prefer MacOS over Linux for various reasons, mostly because
		it tends to be more stable and has better support for professional
		applications. i need stuff like Logic Pro and Final Cut which simply can't
		run on Linux. but i am very much excited for whats going on in the Linux
		space
