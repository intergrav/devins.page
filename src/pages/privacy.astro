		this website is deployed on Cloudflare Pages, and uses Cloudflare Web
		Analytics to help me understand basic traffic information. as of 2025,
		Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics">claims</a> that
		they do not use any client-side state, such as cookies or localStorage, to collect
		usage metrics, and don't fingerprint individuals via IP address, User Agent string,
		or any other data.
	</p>

	<p>
		i do not personally collect, store, or share any visitor data other than
		what cloudflare provides.
